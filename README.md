   The project ‘Kids Learning Box’ is complete Desktop based application designed on digital technology using NetBeans language java platform swing. The main aim of the project is to teaching children English, Math (Addition, Subtraction, Multipel and Division) and even odd and also multiplication table in a digital way. It is a Windows based desktop application which has control automatically in digital way.
   It's never too early to start your child's education. Preschoolers, kindergarteners and older kids are eager to learning their English (Vowel, Consonant – words and sentences), Math (Addition, Subtraction, Multipel, Division and more)! The most attractive things are even odd game and multiplication table. The best way to encourage that is to share smart, well-made educational application and games with them on a daily basis.  Kids Learning Box that will teach your child plays, including: 
   • English - Learn Vowel and Consonant. 
   • Vowel - Children can build their knowledge which one vowel and its words with sentences.  
   • Consonant - Children can build their knowledge which one consonant and its words with sentences.

   • Subtracting Fun - Input two numbers and tap subtraction button and see the correct answer. 
   • Multipel Fun - Input two numbers and tap multipel button and see the correct answer. 
   • Division Fun - Input two numbers and tap division button and see the correct answer. 
   • Even Odd game - See how much your child has improved in their mathematics skills for finding even or odd numbers. 
   • Multiplication Table - See how much your child has improved in their mathematics skills for multiplication.  
When kids can play while they're learning, they're much more likely to recall information. It also makes them want to learn more frequently, which will give them a huge boost when they start kindergarten.
   When creating Kids Learning Box, we focused on building the best possible learning experience for children of all ages. We're parents ourselves, so we know exactly what makes a good educational game, as well as what doesn't. We released Kids Learning Box as a completely learning digital way. Since this is our first project it has some limitation. Due to less knowledge in particular fields and limited time we were not able to fulfill all our expectation that we expected we could do while the project got started. We hope this limitations are considerable.
